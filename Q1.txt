Changes to patient.json

  1. text.div; replaced /n with <br> tags, removed closing div tag because no need for addition div inside another div, and fixed closing <p> tag.
  2. text object did not have opening '{' bracket.
  3. identifier missing semi-colon ':'
  4. made identifier an object instead of an array because array doesn’t seem necessary for one identity.
  5. made name an object as well with properties family and given because this is information for a single patient no need for multiple name objects. 
     each person only has 1 family name and 1 given name no need to make those values an array in my opinion.
  6. closing " on gender property.
  7. conditions array elements weren’t separated properly added a comma.
  8. added commas to separate properties properly.
  9. properties such as name, gender, conditions were added to identifier object.
