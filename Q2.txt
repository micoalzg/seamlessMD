1. The rope attached to the boat.
2. The colour of the liquid in side of barrel.
3. The ears on the sheep second from the right.
4. The number of strawberries 2 versus 3 only the cobblestone path.
5. The railings inside of the gazibo 1 vs 2.
6. The roofing on top of the well. (Number of planks 3 vs 4)
7. The branch between the 2 apple trees. (one is missing)
8. The direction that the soil is pointing is not aligned.
9. The small detail on the middle left side of the picture, hiding behind the popsicle shaped plant.

Roughly took 15 minutes. My strategy was to compare large objects first then look 
at the finer details later, for example, comparing tree to tree and then looking at smaller 
details hidden in the tree like the number of apples.
